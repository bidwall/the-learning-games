# The Learning Games
Learning never stops and starts at the very beginning. The learning games is a series of games, aimed at young kids, designed to help with the fundamental skills in life.

## Counting
This simple game is designed to help kids practice on their counting skills. Count the number of stars, select your answer and check if your are right. If your wrong, don't worry, select another number and try again. Too hard? then redraw to get another set of numbers.

May the odds be ever in your favour :trollface:
